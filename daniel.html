                <p id="para1">Once upon a time, there was a smol boy. This smol boy felt very hungry because he ran out of fud
                    in his fridge. To fix this problem, the smol boy decides to go around the neighborhood asking if his
                    neighbors had any fud.
                </p>
                <p id="para2">
                    The smol boy knocks on the first door, <b>knock knock knock</b>, and the neighbor opens to zer surprise.
                    "Why hello there," the neighbor said, "what brings you to my home today?" Looking up as hungrily as he could,
                    the smol boy said "I'm out of fud so I was wondering if you had any to spare?" The neighbor, taking pity on
                    the smol boy, went in and got him an apple.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph3">
                    After receiving the apple, the smol boy repeats this until his fridge was full of delicious fud. The smol boy is now
                    full from all the fud his kind neighbors gave him. The smol boi is happy now, and lived happily ever after.
