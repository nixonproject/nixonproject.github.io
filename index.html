            <h1>The Nixon Tapes</h1>
            <p id="first_p" class="intro_p" style="padding-top:7%;">
                As part of the Fall 2017 Digital Humanities course taught by Professor Miriam Posner, our
                team was given the Nixon Tapes database to analyze and visualize. From the start, the three
                main objectives of this project has been 1) to develop technical data analytics skills, 2)
                put into practice digital humanities methodologies of handling data, and 3) answer humanist
                questions regarding the Nixon Tapes.
            </p><br/>
            <p class="intro_p">
                President Richard Milhous Nixon has been one of the most
                polarizing figures in modern American history. From re-establishing relationships with China to
                his ultimate downfall during the Watergate scandal, President Nixon will always elicit a strong
                reaction from anyone knowledgeable about American history. While President Nixon’s resignation
                can be claimed as the most dramatic event of his presidency, our team wanted to examine his
                foreign policy decisions with regards to the Vietnam and Cambodia bombings during the peace
                negotiations in 1972.
            </p><br/>
            <p class="intro_p">
                This website is organized into 9 sections, each section either highlights
                a visualization of the dataset or analysis of the dataset. Through these sections, our team
                developed visualizations to explore the following questions:
                <br/><br/>What was the context of President’s Nixon decisions? How did they affect his decisions?

            <h1>Topic Modeling</h1>
            <p>
                One of the humanities questions that the Nixon Tapes team
                posed was how President Nixon’s administration, specifically
                Henry Kissinger, influenced his actions and decisions during
                the December bombings. To answer this question, we found it
                necessary to examine the topics that each individual was involved
                in and analyze how their conversations correlated with each
                topic over time. To accomplish this, we chose to use topic modeling.

                <h1>Network Analysis Pt. 1</h1>
                <p>
                    In this Nixon-centric network analysis, records of conversations used from October 12th,
                    1972 to December 15th, 1972 are arranged into a one-mode network. These key dates were
                    chosen because they mark the establishment of the first October Agreement, leading up
                    to the final decision to begin operations for the December Bombings. The network centers
                    Nixon as the focal point and measures the weight, or the amount of conversations held, between
                    him and another person. In this way, each node is a singular person, with each edge representing
                    Nixon and his or her contact through conversations. Due to an extensive list of names recorded
                    in the dataset, parameters were set for a minimum amount of conversations with Nixon, to
                    ensure a manageable and legible network. For this reason, each edge has a minimum weight
                    of five conversations with Nixon.
                </p><br/>
                <p>
                    Through the creation of this network, we were able to see that Stephen B. Bull, H.R. Haldeman,
                    Alexander Butterfield, and Henry Kissinger were the persons with the most weight during this
                    period. In borrowing the term from network analysis, we see that these conversations do actually
                    hold “weight” in the realization of foreign policy decisions, which ultimately manifested in the
                    resumption of mass bombings in North Vietnam that December. We approach this network in the context
                    of these conversations’ actual gravity in determining the United States further entrenchment into
                    Vietnam, and the furthering of imperial domination in the Global South. The network functions as a
                    simple tool for gauging who took up the most space in the President’s inner circle at the time,
                    perhaps translating to taking up some influence on the administration’s decisions.

                <p>
                    This bimodal network analysis uses edges to denote connections between key figures,
                    with each node having been present in conversation(s) together. Because of the
                    sheer volume of names in the data, conversations were selected according to our
                    list of key dates and decisions leading up to the December Bombings. With these
                    parameters we only included edges that had a weight above five, meaning that each
                    actor had to at least participate in five conversations together. Using the two-mode
                    method of analysis, we were able to visualize the interconnectedness and density of
                    powerful members in Nixon’s cabinet, as well as those who are more on the periphery.

                <p>
                    The network again shows Stephen B. Bull, Henry Kissinger, and H.R. Haldeman as nodes
                    holding the most weight. However, amidst those with broad-reaching authority in the
                    administration are important members of staff who facilitate these conversations and
                    connections, such as the White House operator, the White House photographer, and Nixon’s
                    personal valet, Manolo Sanchez, who has a significant between-centrality. The role these
                    staff members play is essential in allowing the network to function. <br/>

                    Each network was made using OpenRefine, RStudio, D3.js, and Cytoscape.

                Topic Modeling uses machine learning and natural language processing to
                determine topics and ideas based off of input text or data. Topics, in this
                case, refer to a grouping of around 20 words that are closely related. Topic
                modeling provides a standardized methodology to determine content of texts
                without the perspective of a particular historian. This was our first
                attempt at topic modeling. Our process included a 3-step methodology:<br/><br/>
                    1. Cleaning and formatting data<br/>
                    2. Using MALLET to produce the topic models<br/>
                    3. Creating data visualizations from the topic models

                We have chosen to to create an automated visualization of “Operation Linebacker 1”
                and “Operation Linebacker 2,” as the bombings took place over a duration of time.
                The data we used to visualize the bombings was taken from Theater History of Operations
                (THOR) Data: Vietnam War, which is free and publicly available data created by the U.S.
                government. To visualize out data we used CARTO, a free to use map visualizing interface system.

            <p>
                Operation Linebacker 1 occurred between May 9, 1972 and October 23, 1972. Our data shows that
                approximately 12,202 bombings strikes had taken place all throughout North Vietnam-- with high
                concentration of bombings occuring in densely populated areas such as Haiphong, Hanoi, Nam Dinh,
                Than Hoa, and Vinh.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also known as the “December Bombings,” Operation Linebacker 2 occurred between December 18,
                1972 and December 29, 1972. Our data shows that approximately 642 bomb strikes had taken place
                in the upper reaches of North Vietnam-- with a concentration of bombings centered around Hanoi and Haiphong.
