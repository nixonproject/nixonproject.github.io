                    President Richard Milhous Nixon has been one of the most
                    polarizing figures in modern American history. From re-establishing relationships with China to
                    his ultimate downfall during the Watergate scandal, President Nixon will always elicit a strong
                    reaction from people. Our team wanted to examine his
                    foreign policy decisions with regards to the Vietnam and Cambodia bombings during the peace
                    negotiations in 1972.

                        After months of negotiations between the North and South Vietnamese, by December 14th,
                        the Nixon Administration thought all hopes of negotiations have disappeared and a bombing campaign was
                        necessary. From December 18 - 19th, the United States Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps flew 3,420
                        sorties over North Vietnam including up to 120 B-52 sorties per day.
                        During this time, the public became frustrated at Nixon for failing to deliver on his peace talk rhetoric
                        from his presidential campaign.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>
                        Following his presidency, President Nixon attempted to defend this decision by stating it was his
                        secretary of state, Henry Kissinger, who advocated for the bombing while he, President Nixon, wanted to continue to pursue
                        peace talks.
                    </p><br/>
                    <p>
                        To evaluate this claim, the Nixon Tape team analyzed the transcripts of 17 conversations between October 8th
                        to December 28th. The following word cloud was build using analysis produced by topic modeling (described in
                        the section to the right) of the conversations. Topic modeling analysis generated ten topics, grouping of text,
                        and each word cloud represents one of the groupings weighted by relevance to the topic. The labels above each
                        word cloud were determined by the Nixon Tape team based on the words, their relative importance to the topic, and
                        the context of the conversations.

                <p style="font-size:1.1vw;">
                    This conversation in particular is interesting because this took place just following Secretary of State Kissinger's
                    negotiations with the North Vietnamese in Paris. This conversation was also held just after the Washington Post had
                     reported that an FBI investigation had found evidence of a campaign of political sabotage
                    by the Nixon forces that was "unprecedented in scope and intensity." Thus this visualization represents the context
                     as well as each speaker's focus in the conversation.
                </p><br>
                <p style="font-size:1.1vw;">
                    The stacked bar chart represents how similar each speaker's speech in this conversation resembled one of
                    the 10 topics that Mallet had identified. For instance, it is clear that Henry Kissinger and President Nixon's
                    speech topics most closely aligned with "Appeasing on Agreements with Thieu."
                </p><br>
                <p style="font-size:1.1vw;">
                    This visualization was made by first parsing out the conversation by speaker into speaker text files using Python.
                    Then each speaker text files were inputted into Mallet's topic modeling analysis to get the percentage likelihood of
                    the speech matching up with each topic. Finally these percentages were visualized in Google Sheets chart.

                <p>
                    In this Nixon-centric network analysis, records of conversations used from October 12th,
                    1972 to December 15th, 1972 are arranged into a one-mode network. These key dates were
                    chosen because they mark the establishment of the first October Agreement, leading up
                    to the final decision to begin operations for the December Bombings. The network centers
                    Nixon as the focal point and measures the weight, or the amount of conversations held, between
                    him and another person. In this way, each node is a singular person, with each edge representing
                    Nixon and his or her contact through conversations. Due to an extensive list of names recorded
                    in the dataset, parameters were set for a minimum amount of conversations with Nixon, to
                    ensure a manageable and legible network. For this reason, each edge has a minimum weight
                    of five conversations with Nixon.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Through the creation of this network, we were able to see that Stephen B. Bull, H.R. Haldeman,
                    Alexander Butterfield, and Henry Kissinger were the persons with the most weight during this
                    period. In borrowing the term from network analysis, we see that these conversations do actually
                    hold “weight” in the realization of foreign policy decisions, which ultimately manifested in the
                    resumption of mass bombings in North Vietnam that December. We approach this network in the context
                    of these conversations' actual gravity in determining the United States further entrenchment into
                    Vietnam, and the furthering of imperial domination in the Global South. The network functions as a
                    simple tool for gauging who took up the most space in the President's inner circle at the time,
                    perhaps translating to taking up some influence on the administration's decisions.

                <p>
                    This bimodal network analysis uses edges to denote connections between key figures,
                    with each node having been present in conversation(s) together. Because of the
                    sheer volume of names in the data, conversations were selected according to our
                    list of key dates and decisions leading up to the December Bombings. With these
                    parameters we only included edges that had a weight above five, meaning that each
                    actor had to at least participate in five conversations together. Using the two-mode
                    method of analysis, we were able to visualize the interconnectedness and density of
                    powerful members in Nixon's cabinet, as well as those who are more on the periphery.
                </p><br/>
                <p>
                    The network again shows Stephen B. Bull, Henry Kissinger, and H.R. Haldeman as nodes
                    holding the most weight. However, amidst those with broad-reaching authority in the
                    administration are important members of staff who facilitate these conversations and
                    connections, such as the White House operator, the White House photographer, and Nixon's
                    personal valet, Manolo Sanchez, who has a significant between-centrality. The role these
                    staff members play is essential in allowing the network to function. <br/>

                    Each network was made using OpenRefine, RStudio, D3.js, and Cytoscape.

                <p><span style="font-size:2em;">Our</span> team was first given an Excel sheet that shows the start and end dates and times, participants in the conversation, a brief description of said conversation, the location of the conversation, and the release date of the recording. There are other columns as well, but those are for identifying the physical tape itself as opposed to information about the content. The online additions to the dataset provide full transcripts of some conversations and the audio recordings too. The dataset can illuminate the context in which the recordings took place in addition to the geographical and temporal data it provides.

                <p>
                    Additionally, the data was first recorded by way of a audio taping system set up by White House officials. The system recorded many important conversations concerning the Nixon Administration- with recording devices set up in the Oval office, the Cabinet Room, and the Aspen Lodge at Camp David-dating from February 16, 1971 to July 18, 1973. The National Archives has made the recordings readily available to the public through the creation of a standardized and open format. Such formating includes comma-separated values (CSV) files and zipped folders containing seven JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. Moreover, the staff at the National Archives used varying analysis techniques to structure the metadata according time, date, and location of each conversation (which total over 4,000 unique data rows). Interesting enough, the staff used audio translating software to generate writing script of select conversations in order to preserve accuracy of such accounts.

                <p>
                    Furthermore, the original sources of the data are from the national archives of the US government. The White House Tapes contain sound recordings from President Richard Nixon's telephone calls recorded at the White House in Washington D.C. and the Presidential Retreat at Camp David, MD, recordings from meetings in the White House's Oval Office, Cabinet Room, President's office in the Old Office Executive Building, and Aspen Lodge at Camp David. The Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum is part of the National Archives and Records Administration, and is trying to digitize all of the tapes for public use.

                    Moreover, the organization of the dataset is arranged using the given parameters of time, sequence, location, participant in conversation, and collection. As a dataset generated by the National Archives and Records Administration, the presented ontology is intertwined with state power on the federal level. The dataset's relationship with the government informs its ideological framework, using parameters that are in line with the predominating, Western conceptions of time and location. Being a catalogue of conversations held by the president, the situated data is inherently ego-centric. Each entry point revolves around the president, as every record represents a conversation held by officials surrounding him during his administration. There are dense power dynamics contained in the relationships expressed in the data, as these conversations were responsible for policies, and decisions with immense impact.

                    Finally, if our dataset (the initial CSV file) was the only source, some information that would be left out would include the audio recordings, transcripts, and political context of the dataset. While the existence of these tapes say a lot about President Nixon's own insecurities and paranoia within his own administration, the CSV alone does not fully convey these emotions and the user truly gets a better sense by listening to his voice and mannerisms as well as reading through transcripts. Who President Nixon talks to and how he talks with each individual often reflect the stress that he was under that the original CSV file did not since it was primarily made for record-keeping purposes for the Richard Nixon Presidential Library.
